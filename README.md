<h1 align='center'>Welcome to Szymon's Eclectic Anecdotes!<br> This is my personal blog where I'll be sharing my programming and design journey with the rest of the world.</h1>

&nbsp;

<p>The goal of the blog is to give me a blank canvas where I can review and write about what I've explored, learned and accomplished, as well as any programming horror stories I encounter</p>
